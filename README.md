# A CMS for the mathematics club VITCC
This is a place where the admin can upload materials in form of youtube videos and PDFs, so that the users can view it.

## Next.js project bootstrapped with tailwindcss
Other students of the college are welcomed to use this as a base template for their own Content Management System! (For the folks who don't prefer wordpress, or want 0 cost deploymemt since vercel is free!)
